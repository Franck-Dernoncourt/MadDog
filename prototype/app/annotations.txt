Plumer moderated the General Assemblies of two different sects of American Presbyterianism , one in the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America in 1838 and in the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1871 . In both institutions he was a staunch supporter of Old School Presbyterianism . In addition to his career in the pulpit , Plumer was a highly regarded religious instructor , and his teaching positions included : Professor at PTS in Pennsylvania ( 1854–1862 ) ; Professor of Didactic and Polemic Theology ( 1867–1875 ) at Columbia Theological Seminary in South Carolina ; and Professor of Pastoral , Casuistic , and Historical Theology ( 1875–1880 ) at Columbia . Plumer authored at least 25 books , including commentaries on Romans , Hebrews , and Psalms , as well as numerous tracts and pamphlets , and magazine and newspaper articles .

However , President Hossain Mohammad Ershad put an immediate hold to bringing the NSC under full civilian control after seizing state power . It was named the Supreme Command Headquarters after 8 years , on 10 November 1986 sealing armed forces control over national security . After 1991 , the presidential system of government by Act of Parliament was abolished , and by October 1994 , the AFD was integrated into the Prime Minister &#39;s Office and concurrently the combined armed forces authority was transferred to this government body . The AFD provide directive to the military of Bangladesh during disaster relief operations .

It was recently shown that charged AdS boson stars can reproduce the universal structure of the lowest scaling dimension in the subsector of a CFT with fixed large global U(1 ) charge Q. Using the model consisting of Einstein - Maxwell gravity with a negative cosmological constant , coupled to a U(1)-charged conformally massless scalar with the fourth - order self interaction , we construct a class of charged AdS boson star solutions in the large Q limit , where the scalar field obeys a mixed boundary condition , parameterized by k that interpolates between the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions corresponding to k = 0 and ∞ respectively . By varying k , we numerically read off the k dependence of the leading coefficient c3/2 ( k ) ≡ limQ→∞ M / Q3/2 . We find that c3/2 ( k ) is a monotonously increasing function which grows linearly when k is sufficiently small . When k → ∞ , c3/2 ( k ) approaches the maximal value at a decreasing rate given by k −3/2 . We also obtain a close form expression that fits the numerical data for the entire range of k within 10−4 accuracy .
